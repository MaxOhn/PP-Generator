--- IDEAS ---
page scrap to get last ranked/loved/... maps
command showing average max combo, maybe weighted
command to show all scores of mapset
hypothetical command <reach [name] that shows required pp to reach that user
<selfprune to remove own msg (& bot responses)
<osu command to show stats
<urban to show urban dictionary definition of a word/phrase
<suggest <ss pp value> gives top 10 maps (with mods) that have that pp value
