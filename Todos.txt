--- GENERAL ---
check if pp calculation has an update
show top 5 for rb when number <6
set embed color green for hypotheical commands
make <roll try to parse first argument as upper limit, otherwise default to 100
<lb should show a player at most once (either better dt or nc score)

map info for <s(r) not properly alligned

minor refactor for ratio300 in utilOsu.getRank (?)
dont request personal top 100 on <r if map not ranked
add ctb support without any pp calculation
<s still giving -1 50s result
split <top into <top, <topm, and <topt

--- IDEAS ---
page scrap to get last ranked/loved/... maps
command showing average max combo, maybe weighted
command to show all scores of mapset
hypothetical command <reach [name] that shows required pp to reach that user
<selfprune to remove own msg (& bot responses)
<osu command to show stats
<urban to show urban dictionary definition of a word/phrase
<suggest <ss pp value> gives top 10 maps (with mods) that have that pp value
