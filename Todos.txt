--- GENERAL ---
/!\ check if pp calculation has an update /!\
(provide filtering by keys for <topmania)

--- BUGS ---
None :^)

--- IDEAS ---
<suggest <ss pp value> gives top 10 maps (with mods) that have that pp value
    ^ requires handling of _all_ beatmaps first
(command to show all scores of mapset)
(page scrap to get last ranked/loved/... maps)

--- SCRATCHED ---
reformat <ratio via whitespaces in field instead of description
    - cant do, JDA removes whitespaces in fields too
provide opportunity to get lb of other countries with lb/rlb
    - no access through current api
<wolfram to show result of query
    - not in maven repo
<selfprune to remove own msg (& bot responses)
    - author not properly retrievable through bot message
